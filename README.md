LoveSense, The worst idea ive had in a long while. For gta5 -  Dll to bind controller rumble + more to lovense api (sex toy (epic))


This project is archived because of these 2 resons:

1. skill issue on my part ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2. Rockstar doesnt seem to use the  pad rumble native functions? (likely they use xinput/winapi for controller rumble?)


I dont personally own one to test. This was made as a joke, it probably works ( kinda, the test vibrations should work?)


Im not responsible if this breaks anything, because odds are it will
